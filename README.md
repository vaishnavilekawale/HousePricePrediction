# ​ House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features—like location, size, bedrooms, etc.—using a regression model built with Python and scikit-learn.

##  Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize or scale features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create or select important variables to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting (optional)
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root MSE (RMSE), and R² Score.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare performance across multiple regression algorithms to select the best performer.

##  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and modeling
